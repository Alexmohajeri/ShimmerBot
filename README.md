Discord bot to send reminders of upcoming races

This Discord bot is used to send reminders of upcoming race times on a weekly basis.
I used replit to host the bot on a web server, and used uptimerobot to keep the bot alive.
The following video was used as a reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPTfmiYiuok

Remember to set up a TOKEN environment variable for your bot
